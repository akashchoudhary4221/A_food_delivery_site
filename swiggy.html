            <p class="center">Swiggy came into existence in the year 2014 when two BITS Pilani graduates, Sriharsha
                Majety and Nandan Reddy came up with the concept ‘Hyper local food delivery’. They get acquainted with
                Rahul Jaimini, who rejuvenated this vision with a principle site.
                Swiggy is India’s largest online food item ordering & delivery chain, it also tops the chart of India
                Unicorn startup lists. It’s a Bangalore based startup started in 2014, and as of now, it’s expanded to
                more than 100 Indian cities. Swiggy propelled quick pick and drop food delivery applications to make the
                life of people simpler.It gives a single window to request from an extensive variety of restaurants
                along with an entire food entering and conveyance arrangement that connects neighbourhood eateries with
                foodies.
