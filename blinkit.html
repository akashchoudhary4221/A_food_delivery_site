            <p class="center">We want our customers to focus on the more important things for themselves and not need to
                plan for the little things that life needs on an everyday basis. We are here to get your chores out of
                your way.
                Our mission is – “instant commerce indistinguishable from magic”. Using a backbone of technology, data
                sciences, and rich customer insights, we've built a dense and fast network of partner stores enabling
                lightning fast deliveries in minutes.
                We are already one of the largest e-grocery companies in India. Our ambition however, is to be 100x this
                size in the next five years.
                "Blinkit" is owned & managed by "Blink Commerce Private Limited” (formerly known as Grofers India
                Private Limited) and is not related, linked or interconnected in whatsoever manner or nature, to
                “GROFFR.COM” which is a real estate services business operated by “Redstone Consultancy Services Private
                Limited”.</p>
